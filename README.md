# Analyzing Gapminder Data
# The data used is available at gapminder.org/data/. It provides information from 5 continents with 142 countries, and values for life expectancy, gross domestic production per capita, and population. This data was provided every 5 years starting from 1952 and ending in 2007.
# Our analysis of the data shows relationships that exist between several of the variables. We have graphed these not only once but twice, using different forms of graphs, for example, scatter plots and box plots. 
# The purpose was to see if trends existed but also to determine which graph showed that a relationship existed and what similarities, differences and variations that occur between the two.
# We have also provided graphs that seem out of context in that no relationship occurs between the variables but is important so we can look at other variables.
